    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Hey! 
      <br>Here I would like to share my study plan for this semester. In the spring semester, I took a total of 15  
      <br>credits of courses. But for these courses, I mainly focused on math, algorithms, web basics, and English writing. 
      <br>About the pre-reading. 
      <br>The day before each class, I would preview the content of the next day's class, noting down any concepts or steps that I
      <br>didn't quite understand. Or if there are any questions about the chapter. If I had friends who had taken the course, I 
      <br>would talk to them first about what the hardest part of the course was. Gathering more information about the course you have chosen will help you learn better.
      <br> About the assignments. 
      <br>I usually read through the assignment requirements first to estimate a completion time based on my experience.
      <br>Roughly think about the general framework of the project and what syntax will be used. If the assignment is 
      <br> difficult and there are many concepts that I am not familiar with, I will start writing it in advance because
      <br> I don't know what problems I will encounter. Once you encounter a problem you can't solve, you can ask the instructor in advance of the class or after the class. 
      <br>About the review. 
      <br>Usually, I will divide the course according to its difficulty and how much I think I have learned. 
      <br>If the chapter of the week I think is not too difficult, I will read some additional content about the chapter.
      <br> If there is something I don't understand about the week's chapter that I can't explain to others fluently. I will focus on what I don't understand and try to figure it out. Usually, I don't let what I don't understand be left until next week.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I think my target customers are students. Maybe seeking how to get a study plan. Maybe through this site, they would know others' study plans and create themself plans. Here is just a framework. It doesn't give details about each course plan. My audience usually accesses my site through an internet link.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
